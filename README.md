# **Multimodal Security Analysis Agent**  

## **Overview**  
Each year, over **900TB** of security footage is recorded, yet much of it is still **manually reviewed**, leading to **human error** and **missed critical events**. Our team is developing an **AI-powered multimodal analysis agent** to help **law enforcement, security teams, and public safety organizations** process and analyze vast amounts of **audio and video** footage efficiently.  

By leveraging state-of-the-art AI models, our system identifies and flags **potentially critical incidents**, such as:  
✅ **Abuse of power**  
✅ **Excessive force**  
✅ **Unlawful activities**  

## **Technology Stack**  
🚀 **Backend:** Python  
🌐 **Frontend:** TypeScript, React.js, CSS  
🎙 **Audio Analysis:** OpenAI Whisper & OpenAI API  
📽 **Video Analysis:** OpenAI CLIP  

## **How It Works**  
### 🔊 **Audio Analysis**  
- Audio files are **converted to WVE** for structured post-analysis.  
- OpenAI’s **Whisper** API transcribes and detects key phrases relevant to security concerns.  

### 🎥 **Video Analysis**  
- OpenAI **CLIP** extracts and breaks apart scenes based on **keyframes**.  
- The system **analyzes frames** against specific search parameters to detect **anomalous behavior** and **security risks**.  

## **What We Learned**  
Throughout the hackathon, we encountered and overcame several challenges:  
- **Multimodal Complexity:** Combining **audio and video analysis** efficiently required careful synchronization and computational resources.  
- **Defining Search Parameters:** Developing a **robust filtering mechanism** to detect specific security threats took multiple iterations.  
- **Scalability Considerations:** Processing large datasets in **real-time** demands an optimized **pipeline and cloud-based solutions** for deployment.  
- **Bias & Ethics in AI:** Ensuring that our model **minimizes bias** and operates within **ethical guidelines** is crucial for adoption in real-world applications.  

## **Future Improvements**  
Moving forward, we would enhance our system by:  
✅ **Implementing real-time processing** with GPU acceleration and cloud services.  
✅ **Enhancing model accuracy** by integrating **fine-tuned video datasets** tailored to security scenarios.  
✅ **Building an interactive dashboard** with live flagging and human-in-the-loop validation.  
✅ **Expanding multilingual support** for broader accessibility in **global security operations**.  
✅ **Integrating additional security data** like **facial recognition** (with ethical safeguards) and **pattern detection** for behavioral analysis.  

## **Impact**  
By combining **multimodal AI analysis** with **real-world security needs**, our solution enhances **situational awareness**, reduces **manual workload**, and **improves response times** for critical events.
